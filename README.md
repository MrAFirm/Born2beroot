# Born2beroot
Born2beroot is one of three separate projects from the second circle after validating your first project in the Core Programme. It consists of you setting up a Virtual Machine using either Debian or Rocky, and configuring the rules of each user with sudo, and ports with Ufw, along with displaying certain system information like CPU, RAM, DISK usage etc for the mandatory part.

For the bonus part, we are to set up a WordPress Website with Lighttpd, MariaDB, PHP and a choice between Apache2 and NGINX for your service.
